Revision 0.0.1, released XX-01-2020
-----------------------------------

- Added `PUT /snmpsim/mgmt/v1/recordings/<recording>` endpoint which (unlike
  POST) will create new or override existing recording.
- When creating new recordings, also create all directories leading to the
  recording being created. When recording is deleted, try to also remove
  its directory if it's empty.
- Fixed WSGI servers default config initialization.
- When failing to create/override a recording, return HTTP code 490 instead
  of 404.
- Added example systemd unit files for all control panel components.
- Renamed REST API specs into `snmpsimd-mgmt` and `snmpsim-metrics` on Swagger
  and moved spec files into specs folder.
- Removed SQL cascading from all management API models. That makes SNMP
  simulator entities less dependent from each other when deleting some
  of them what facilitates their reuse.
